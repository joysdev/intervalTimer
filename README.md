Welcome to my interval timer app. My goal is to build a timer that will be primarily useful for figure models, with customizable sequences of repeating timers with a few options for alert tones.


Pseudo code:

While the time is not 0, keep counting down by one second.
If the time is 0 sound/flash, then move to next timer, while there are more timers.
If there are no more timers, special sound/flash.
