<!To include: 
sequence name
number of poses
all poses equal time/add each separately
choose a switch pose tone & volume
choose an end of sequence tone & volume

timer only needs to include seconds and minutes

save sequences

buttons:
 new sequence
 start sequence
 quit sequence
 saved sequences

inputs:
 seconds
 minutes
 tone
 volume
